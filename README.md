# recipe_import
Import recipes from websites into a clean format so that it can be added to notes more easily.

I don't even know if this is possible to do yet, but I'd like to create a script that just imports a recipe from a website and creates a nice formated .txt for easy copy/pasteing into notes (mac)

Maybe even figure out how to make a note right away

This is mainly for fun for now so I can learn how to code, but it gives me something to work on for now.
